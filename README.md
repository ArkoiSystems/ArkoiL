# <img src="assets/logo.png" height="28px" /> Arkoi Language

This repository contains the ``compiler``, ``integrations`` of the language and ``examples``
for the Arkoi Language. For more information about ArkoiL, including downloads and documentation
for the latest release, check out [ArkoiL's website](https://lang.arkoisystems.com/).

## Getting Started

To build and test this repository you'll need JDK 11 or higher. Eventually this project will
be ported to JDK 14 because it's the newer version with LTS. To check if you have JDK 11 or
higher installed use this command to check your current version:
```
java -version
```
which should output something like this:
```
openjdk version "11.0.6" 2020-01-14
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.6+10-post-Ubuntu-1ubuntu118.04.1)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.6+10-post-Ubuntu-1ubuntu118.04.1, mixed mode, sharing)
```

Also if you want to build any example (or self written code), you also need to install 
LLVM 10.0.0. ``LLVM4J`` will find the library by itself and so you don't need to do anything
else.

Check out ``LLVM4J`` on this README for more details about it, and a link which will redirect
you to the offical repository.

## Integration

Currently there is just an plugin for IntelliJ to support the Arkoi Language. If other IDEs
or text editors are desired, these suggestions can be created via ``Issues``.

``ArkoiIntegration`` is the official IntelliJ Plugin which you can find in this repository
under ``integration``.

Also if someone wants to create their own Arkoi Integration in their favourit IDE or text
editor, they can make a pull request, so I can add it to the ``integration`` folder.

If you're not familar with making a pull request using GitHub and/or git, please read 
[this guide](pull-request-instructions).

## LLVM4J

``LLVM4J`` is a sideproject of the Arkoi Language which is necessary, because there are no
up to date repositorys which made an LLVM Wrapper for Java. It covers the entire C API instead
of the C++ API, because it's more stable than the C++ API. Thereforce it will take some time,
until changes arrive in the C API.

If you want to learn more about it, you can visit the offical ``LLVM4J`` repository [here](https://github.com/Excse/LLVM4J).

## Contributing

If you're interested in the development of ArkoiL, please make sure you read the documentation
and youre familiar with the structure of the project. To give a bit information about the 
structure, I did a short summary:

* ``compiler/`` - the compiler source code.
* ``integration/`` - the integrations plugins/extensions.
   * ``intellij`` - plugin for the IntelliJ IDE.
* ``examples`` - examples which you can use to test the language.
* ``natives`` - functions which are directly included to the language (the location will change in the future).

## Gradle

``gradle`` is used as an build-automation system tool which provides flexible project 
structures. It is used to build the project and also to generate documentations just with
one click (or command).

If you want to learn more about it, you can visit the offical gralde repository [here](https://github.com/gradle/gradle).

## Maven 

``maven`` is a software project managment and comprehension tool. With it you can 
use external libraries just with a few lines and so you dont need to download anything
manually. In combination with ``gradle`` the process gets even easier, because now
you can use the build.gradle file to setup everything.
